## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for the frontend integration feature. Created 48 specific tasks organized across 5 phases: Setup (4 tasks), Foundational (6 tasks), and 3 User Stories (20 tasks for US1, 12 tasks for US2, 14 tasks for US3), plus 2 polish/cross-cutting tasks. Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, parallelism markers [P], story labels [US1/US2/US3], and specific file paths. Tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story, with proper dependency management and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed task breakdown enabling step-by-step frontend implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with 48 specific implementation tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully organized tasks by user story for independent development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of setup tasks
