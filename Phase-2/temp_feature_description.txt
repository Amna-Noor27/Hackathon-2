Project: Todo Full-Stack Web Application Spec-1 (Backend Core & Data Layer)
Target audience:
- Hackathon reviewers evaluating backend correctness and spec adherence
- Developers reviewing API design and data integrity

Focus:
- Persistent task management backend
- Clean RESTful API design
- Secure, user-scoped data handling (pre-auth-ready)

Success criteria:
- All task CRUD operations implemented via REST APIS
- Data persisted in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- SQLModel used for schema and ORM operations
- All endpoints correctly scoped by user_id
- API responses follow HTTP standards (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
- Backend runs independently of frontend

Constraints:
- Backend only (no frontend dependency)
- Tech stack is fixed:
  - FastAPI
  - SQLModel
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- No authentication enforcement yet (handled in Spec-2)
- All behavior must be spec-defined before planning
- No manual coding; Claude Code only

Not building:
- Authentication or JWT validation
- Frontend UI or API client
- Role-based access control
- Advanced task features (tags, priorities, reminders)
- Background jobs or real-time updates
